This is a summary of the math and implementation of the Stanford Machine learning course in R and not Octave. In this summary we will look at:\n\n* Cost Function\n* Gradient Descent Method\n* Logistic Regression\n* Neural Networks\n\n## Cost Function\n\nThe objective of linear regression is to minimize the cost function:\n$$ J( \\theta ) = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i=1}^n(h_\\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2 $$\nwhere the hypothesis $h_{\\theta}(x)$ is given by a linear model\n\n$$h_{\\theta}(x) =\\theta^{T}x = \\theta_0 + \\theta_{1}x_{1}$$\n\nOne optimization technique that can be used to solve this problem is the [Gradient Descent Method](#Gradient Descent Method) described in the next section. \n\nSome users might already know that an analytical solution for a linear regression cost function mentioned above in the form of least squares maximum likelihood estimation. Gradient Descent Method is a broader implementation of convex optimization and has a number of applications outside of linear regression model fitting. When the number of input features is significantly large the gradient descent method might actually outpeform the least square estimator defined by \n\n$$(X^TX)^{-1}X^{T}y$$\n\n## Gradient Descent Method\n\n## Logistic Regression\n\n## Neural Networks\n\n",
