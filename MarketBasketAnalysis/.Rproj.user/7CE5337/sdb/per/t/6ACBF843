For an online retailer, each item is a product in the shop. For a publisher, each item might be an article, a blog post, a video etc. A group of items is an item set.\n\n$$I = \\{i_1,i_2,...,i_m\\}$$\nTransactions are instances of groups of items co-occuring together. For an online retailer, a transaction is, generally, a, transaction. For a publisher, a transaction might be the group of articles read in a single visit to the website. (It is up to the analyst to define over what period to measure a transaction.) For each transaction, then, we have an item set.\n\n$$t_n = \\{i_h,i_j,i_k,... \\} \\space where \\space h,j,k \\in 1,..,m $$\n\n### Support\nThe frequency which the item set appears within the transaction data.The support of ${\\displaystyle X}$ with respect to ${\\displaystyle T}$ is defined as the proportion of transactions ${\\displaystyle t}$ in the database which contains itemset ${\\displaystyle X}$.\n\n$${\\displaystyle \\mathrm {supp} (X)={\\frac {|\\{t\\in T;X\\subseteq t\\}|}{|T|}}}$$\n\n### Confidence\n\nConfidence is an indication of how often the rule has been found to be true.\n\nThe confidence value of a rule, ${\\displaystyle X\\Rightarrow Y}$ , with respect to a set of transactions ${\\displaystyle T}$, is the proportion of the transactions that contains ${\\displaystyle X}$ which also contains ${\\displaystyle Y}$.\n\nConfidence is defined as:\n\n$${conf}(X \\Rightarrow Y)=\\frac{{\\mathrm {supp}}(X\\cup Y)}{{\\mathrm {supp}}(X)}$$\n\nAn interpretation for the rule is as follows: item$_1$\n\nThe rule item$_1$,item$_3$ $\\Rightarrow$ item$_3$ has the confidence of 0.16/0.2 = 0.8 meaning that for all of the transactions containing item$_1$ and item$_2$ the rule is correct 80% of the time. (i.e if a person bought item$_1$ and item$_2$ they bought item$_3$ as well 80% of the time)\n\n### Lift\n\nThe lift of a rule is defined as:\n\n$$\\mathrm {lift}(X \\Rightarrow Y) = \\frac{\\mathrm {supp}(X \\cup Y)}{\\mathrm {supp}(X) \\times \\mathrm {supp}(Y)}$$\nThe lift of the rule should be maximized as this indicates the more dependancy on the items. Lift equal to one is indicative of indepence. \n\nThe value of lift is that it considers both the confidence of the rule and the overall data set.\n\n### Conviction\n\nThe conviction of a rule is defined as\n\n$$\\mathrm {conv}(X \\Rightarrow Y) = \\frac{1- \\mathrm{supp}(Y)}{1 - \\mathrm {conf}(X \\Rightarrow Y)}$$\nand can be interpreted as the ratio of the expected frequency that X occurs without Y. That is A conviction of 1.2 shows the rule would be incorrect 20% more often if the association between X and Y was purely random chance.\n\nIn R the arules package makes this process exteremely easy.\n\n## Getting into the code\n\n\n",
