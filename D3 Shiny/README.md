D3 Shiny

This is a basic Hello World to integrate and use D3 libraries with RShiny in order to make interactive Shiny apps that not only combine the power of R but include the slick visualizations from D3.

I have kept it very simple and tried to avoid shortcuts to ensure anyone wanting to try this out can easily figure out how to get started. 

More functionality and cool visualizations will be added soon.
